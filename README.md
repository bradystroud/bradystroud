### Hi there, I'm Brady.

I am an aspiring Software Developer from Brisbane.

I work with multiple development tools and languages such as:
 * Flutter/Dart
 * Python

I am currently learning:
 * .NET Development using C#
 * Angular
 * C

This November, after I graduate high school, I'm starting an internship as a software developer with SSW Brisbane, where I will learn more about the industry, gain experience working as part of a team, and refine my development skills. After completing the three-month internship, I hope to find an entry-level job in Mobile App Development.
